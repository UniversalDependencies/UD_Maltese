The file currently present in this repository is a fraction of a tagged corpus provided by Mike Rosner,
then processed by Dan Zeman (mid 2015):

- converted to CoNLL-U
- parsed by Malt parser, delexicalized model trained on UD Italian
- manually fixed obvious problems (based on POS tags and dictionary)
- conversion to UD v2 by Martin Popel and Udapi (2017)

pending quality assesment by a native speaker. Then a new parser could be trained on this sample and
used to bootstrap a larger treebank of Maltese (with subsequent hand-correction again).

Note: another Maltese treebank is being prepared by Slavomír Čéplö. When it is ready, it will either
replace the data here, or the two efforts may be merged.
