# Summary
MUDT (Maltese Universal Dependencies Treebank) is a manually annotated treebank of Maltese, a Semitic language of Malta descended from North African Arabic with a significant amount of Italo-Romance influence.
MUDT was designed as a balanced corpus with four major genres - news, parliamentary debates, fiction and non-fiction - represented equally.

# Introduction
This treebank is the product of the PhD thesis *Constituent order in {Maltese}: A quantitative analysis* by Slavomír Čéplö. The text (see References) contains a detailed description of the annotation decisions and composition of the treebank.
The treebank was originally produced on accordance with UDv1, this version is brought up to the UDv2.3 standard.
